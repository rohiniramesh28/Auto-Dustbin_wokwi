Real-time Distance Monitoring:

The serial monitor displays the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.

Object Detection:

When an object is detected within 10 cm, the dustbin lid automatically opens, and the buzzer emits a beep sound.

The lid remains open for 3 seconds before closing.

No Object Scenario:

If no object is detected, the lid remains closed, and the buzzer stays off.
